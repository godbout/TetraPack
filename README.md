# WHY TETRAPACK? #

I am a big defender of animals rights therefore I hate that people who work with a computer always keep on disturbing and maltreating their mouse. Also (for very intimate reasons) I don't like using the common arrow keys to move my cursor in text editors. And to finish, I hate Microsoft Office and love peanut butter and Tsing Tao beer.

# SO WHAT DOES TETRAPACK BRING ME? #

The purpose of the TetraPack is to move your little hands as less as possible when using the sublime "Sublime Text 2" text editor.
So you'll get some cool nice shortcuts (mainly optimized for programmation in PHP for the moment).

# WHY 'TETRAPACK'? #

No idea. Just poppep up in mind and I think it sounds great, not to say sublime.

# WHAT IS AVAILABLE NOW? #

* a cool macro to add a semicolon (;) at the end of a line and to go to the next line afterward (ok, it's like the command+return on Mac but with adding a (;) at the end of the line)

# WHAT IS COMING NEXT? #

* go to next closing bracket
* go to previous opening bracket
